The goal of hypatia is to enable SQUIRE to be run on an individual basis
rather than aggregate

## Installation

You can install the released version of hypatia from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("hypatia")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mrc-ide/hypatia")
```

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub\!
